# FAQs

## The Newsletter

Why newsletter?

- Our WIUI Instagram posts are reserved for big news that takes a long time to research and make, making us unable to update as frequently. Through this newsletter we’ll be able to update you more frequently on more bite-sized but still relevant news, op-ed, and even fun interactive features for a fuller WIUI experience.

How is WIUI’s newsletter different from other newsletters out there?

- WIUI presents news in digestible English that’s accessible for beginner audiences yet also thought-provoking for our more well-versed readers. It’s also made by young people, for young people, and we prioritize presenting news in an engaging and relatable way. In addition to news, we also provide recommended readings and pop culture for readers interested in deepening and widening their knowledge on Indonesian politics and society.

Who is the target audience for WIUI’s newsletter?

- WIUI’s primary target audience has always been Indonesian youth who feel more comfortable digesting information in English. May it be because you are educated in a predominantly English speaking school, went to university abroad, or born/raised overseas. However, we are not restricted to that. Whoever you are, if you are interested in reading about Indonesian sociopolitics in English, we recommend that you give it a try!

Why does WIUI only write in English?

- WIUI was founded based on the realization that there was a lack of information on social and political happenings in Indonesia in English. Because of this, a lot of privileged Indonesians, most of whom were educated in English-speaking schools, weren’t knowledgeable and were disinterested in what was happening in their country. Thus, WIUI decided to write in English in an effort to fill in a gap in the Indonesian news market in order to increase the political interest and participation of English-speaking Indonesian youth.

Who writes the WIUI newsletter?

- WIUI’s newsletter is written by a team of four dedicated and amazing volunteers. All of us are currently university students and aren’t professional journalists. With this in mind, we always remind our readers to verify and double-check the information we provided, and encourage them to do their own research.

I have subscribed but I can’t see your emails in my inbox.

- Check your spam folder. If it’s still not in there, email us at [whatisupindonesia@gmail.com](mailto:whatisupindonesia@gmail.com) and we’ll double check that all your details are correct.

How can WIUI ensure my data privacy?

- The data you input upon subscribing will only be use for WIUI’s insight on our audience internally. This will help us get to know you better! We will not sell or share your data to anyone else.

## Our Subscription Model

Is the WIUI Newsletter free or paid?

- Basically both. We give you the option to subscribe for free or to pay a certain amount. You get to decide how much you’d like to pay for it as well.

Why the paid option?

- Right now, WIUI is still figuring out our business model. By choosing to pay for our newsletter, you will be supporting us in our journey towards sustainability. If you love WIUI & like us to stay independent (and alive), do consider! We appreciate any amount.

I want to support WIUI but I am not yet financially able. What can I do?

- Thank you for wanting to support us and our vision! There are many ways you can support us that do not take the form of subscriptions or donations. You can follow our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/whatisupindonesia/) and share our posts on your stories and to your friends. You can also support us by interacting with us on our socials!

## Independence & Integrity

What is WIUI’s political stance?

- As much as we try to be neutral, WIUI’s writers in general are young, English-speaking and internationally-educated. This means that we may have a particular view of the world and take similar political stances. Although we do our best to not make these visible in our posts, please keep in mind that WIUI is not run by professional journalists and hence, that you should always double-check and verify our information.

How does WIUI ensure editorial independence and integrity?

- WIUI will always be transparent about any political biases we show and we encourage all readers to double-check and verify the information we provide. WIUI will also be transparent about any sponsored writings and the form and shape of support that WIUI is provided from external parties.
